# Exercise: Use Cases

> This exercise should be done in groups of 2 to 3 people.

A School like KEA wants a system where information about students enrolled can be handled. KEA wants to be able to Create a new student, edit an existing student, delete a student, and see all information about a specific student.

Your job in your groups is to write use cases for these 4 scenarios

The approach is like follows:

* Identify use cases for the system.
* Identify actor(s) for the specific use case.
* Write the scenario of the use case.

We will look at a few of your solutions later today, så you should be able to show what you did at the blackboard.
